# intro-to-parsing-stack

This repo is going to:

+ reorganize the programs in Jake Wheat's introduction to parsing with Haskell and Parsec(https://github.com/JakeWheat/intro_to_parsing) according to [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org/)â€™s convention

+ test all programs with latest GHC and parsec package

In this initial version, we use `--resolver=lts-3.22` (GHC 7.10.2), `parsec == 3.1.9`, making the environment as similar to the Author's as possible.
